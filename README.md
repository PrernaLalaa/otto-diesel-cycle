# Thermodynamic Cycles

This repository contains MATLAB codes for analyzing and simulating the **Otto Cycle** (Spark Ignition engine) and **Diesel Cycle** (Compression Ignition engine). These are fundamental thermodynamic cycles used to model internal combustion engines.  

---

## 📌 Features  

- Calculates **state variables** (P, V, T) at all major cycle points  
- Computes **cycle efficiency, heat addition, heat rejection, and net work done**  
- Plots **P–V diagram** of the cycle  
- Generates a **Compression Ratio (CR) vs Efficiency graph** to show thermodynamic trends
